# WorldTravel
Full-stack application where the frontend and backend are tightly integrated. On the frontend, i have used HTML, CSS and React to create an interactive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes using responsive design. The page includes interactive elements like buttons, forms, and dynamic content, which are powered by JavaScript.
